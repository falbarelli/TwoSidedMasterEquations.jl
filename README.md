# TwoSidedMasterEquations.jl
Julia code to solve a time-dependent two-sided master equation exploiting the functionality of the `QuantumOptics` package.
The application is the computation of the QFI of the quantum state of the field emitted by a quantum system, following [Yang, Huelga & Plenio, Phys. Rev. X 13, 031012](https://journals.aps.org/prx/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevX.13.031012).
